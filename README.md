# ðŸ’¿ Building a Virtual Machine Image

How To Run: 
`git clone` this repo 
`cd` into the directory
then
```
npm i
npm link
# Build the custom docker image
p init
# Build rootfs, extract kernel, initrd and package as iso.
p build
```
P.S. Make sure all the .sh file is executable before first try.  
For example, 
```
chmod +x /lib/scripts/package-iso.sh
chmod 777 /my-vol/createVS.sh
```

After successful build, a `disk.img` and `jn.iso` will be in the `my-vol` folder.  
`cd` into `my-vol`, then run `./create.sh` to create the Virtual Machine.
